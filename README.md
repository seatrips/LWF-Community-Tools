## A central repository, with links to all LWF community developed tools.

Community developed tools are very important for LWF and we want to support talented developers from all coding backgrounds. 

The time and effort each community developer invests into creating something awesome for LWF is invaluable.

We all know it’s hard to keep track of the links to 100’s of really useful code repositories, trying to find the right tool quickly can be frustrating.  So we have developed this repository with the aim of creating a centralised list of tools, containing links to the specific tool repository.  

One of the benefits of this setup is that LWF doesn’t host a fork of the repository, but only needs to maintain a link to the users own repository.

Users can submit their dpos tool links by logging an issue, specifying the following:

- Repo URL
- Title of the tool
- Repo owner
- Slack ID

Each month, the newest tools will be included in a monthly Github bounty programme for issues or pull requests on the main LWF repository.  Bounties will be awarded based on impact of the pull/issue logged/bug identified, new tools, upgrades to existing tools, api wrappers and documentation.

More details about the LWF Github bounty program will be released in the next few weeks.
